# Confluence
Node editor for live creation of audio-visual scenes in Unity.

Uses [xNode from Siccity](https://github.com/Siccity/xNode) as a base.

You can create a RuntimeGraph in the Project window with Right-click > Create > RuntimeGraph.

Then double-click anywhere in the graph and type the name of your node to add it to the graph.

This is very early development and will probably change a lot.
