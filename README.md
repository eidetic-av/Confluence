# Confluence
Node editor for live creation of audio-visual scenes within the Unity editor.

This is very early development.
A lot of features are not yet implemented and the code will probably change a lot.

## Use

At the moment you need to first add RuntimeNodeUpdater to your scene.

You can create a RuntimeGraph in the Project window with Right-click > Create > RuntimeGraph.

Double-click anywhere in the graph and type the name of your node to add it to the graph.

To create your own node, extend RuntimeNode.
A RuntimeNode can override Start() and Update() to influence game logic.

See the xNode documentation below to learn how to create Input and Output ports.
